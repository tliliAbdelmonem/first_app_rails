= The Depot Online Store

This application implements an online store, with a catalog, cart, and orders.

It is divided into three main sections:

* The buyer's side of the application manages the catalog, cart, and
  checkout. It is implemented in StoreController and the associated
  views.

* Only administrators can access stuff in the AdminController. 
  This is implemented by the LoginController, and is enforced by the     
  ApplicationController#authorize method.

* There's also a simple web service accessible via the InfoController.

This code was produced as an example for the book {Agile Web
Development with
Rails}[http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2]. It should not be
run as a real online store.
